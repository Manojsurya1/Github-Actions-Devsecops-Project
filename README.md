# Github-Actions-Devsecops-Project
This GitHub Actions project showcases a fully automated CI/CD pipeline integrated with multiple DevOps tools. It utilizes a self-hosted runner to execute various build jobs, beginning with Maven for code compilation and unit testing. Security and quality checks are embedded throughout the pipeline using Trivy for filesystem vulnerability scanning, Gitleaks for detecting hardcoded secrets, and SonarQube for static code analysis and quality gate enforcement. The pipeline then packages the application into a JAR, builds and pushes Docker images, and deploys to a Kubernetes cluster using kubectl and a configured kubeconfig for seamless deployments. The setup ensures end-to-end automation with security, code quality, and deployment best practices
